# Amon_Link
PROJECT IN PROGRESS...
External electronics for RF communication between PC (GroundControl) and Amon lander drone
First version made on perfboard with Arduino Nano and two NRF24L01. Programed in Microchip studio.
For communication it usees 2.4GHz frequency and homemade protocol (codes for comands and telemetry)
Verion 2 will be made on custom PCB and probably with RISC-V MCU
